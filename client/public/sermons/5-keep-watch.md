# Keep Watch: Hidden Identities and New Creation

**Core Scripture:** Romans 8:19-21, Colossians 3:3-4, 1 John 3:2

## Key Point 1: Creation Waits for Us, Not Technology

Romans 8 makes clear: creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be *revealed*. Not for the earth to be transformed into computational substrate. Not for AGI or the singularity. Creation groans for the revealing of the character and nature of citizens of the Kingdom—those shaped into the cruciform nature of Jesus. We are what creation is waiting for.

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Romans 8:19-21 | "For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God." |
| Romans 8:23 | "Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption to sonship, the redemption of our bodies." |

## Key Point 2: Our True Identity Is Hidden in Christ

Your identity is not found in your accomplishments, your technology, or your empire. It is hidden with Christ in God. This true self will be revealed when Christ is revealed. We are being shaped now—often through suffering and wilderness—into who we truly are. Keep watch means watching with eager expectation for this revelation, this becoming.

|-----------|------|
| Colossians 3:3-4 | "For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory." |
| 1 John 3:2 | "Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when Christ appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is." |
| 1 Peter 1:4 | "and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade. This inheritance is kept in heaven for you." |

## Key Point 3: Spiritual Formation: Abiding, Not Striving

John Mark Comer's three points are goals, not tasks: Be with Jesus, Become like Him, Do as He did. Our only task is the first—be with Jesus. Abide. Trust. Seek His kingdom. Jesus does the transforming. Jesus empowers the doing. If AGI and technological acceleration shape us into better servants of our neighbors, better lovers of the poor, then perhaps the Lord is using these tools for His purposes—not as savior, but as refining fire.

### Scripture

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| John 15:4-5 | "Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing." |
| Deuteronomy 29:6 | "You ate no bread and drank no wine or other fermented drink. I did this so that you might know that I am the LORD your God." |

*What is creation actually waiting for? Are we watching for technology or for the revealing of Christ in us? Abide in Him—that is our only task.*
