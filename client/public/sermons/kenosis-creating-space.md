**Core Scripture:** Philippians 2:7

—

Like many - my life started with many expectations.
Expectations from my parents, from myself, from society.

Each of these expecations always had a flavor of finding fulfillment.
Lets examine that word.
Ful-fill-ment. To fill up completely. Often as the succesful accomplishment of an achievement.
Filling myself. Accomplishing things.
In various forms of personality tests, I’m definitely the “Achiever” or something similar. My default mode is to accomplish and get a list of successes that I can look back on and say “I did it!”
I love a TODO list and checking it off.
Part of that dopamine kick of finishing things may come from video games. Beating the game and getting that next level and powering up. Even modern media has this tendency to form us into creatures that try to FILL ourselves with achievements.

## Key Point 1: God Empties Before He Fills

The Trinitarian pattern shows us that God Himself operates through kenosis—the Father empties all of Himself into the Son, and the Son empties all of Himself into the Spirit. This self-limitation is not weakness but the ultimate expression of divine love and power. Christ’s incarnation demonstrates that power-under (submission and service) triumphs over power-over (domination and control).

| Philippians 2:5-7 | "In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant..." |
| Romans 1:20 | "For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made..." |

## Key Point 2: Patience Creates Spacious Places for Repentance

God's patience is not passive waiting but active creation of space. He creates wide open wilderness for our sin to be sent out (like the scapegoat), giving us room to wander, fail, and return. This spacious patience becomes the model for how we should treat others—not in judgment, but in creating space for grace and transformation.

| Psalm 18:19 | "He brought me out into a spacious place; he rescued me because he delighted in me." |
| Romans 2:4 | "Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that God's kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?" |
| Romans 2:15 | "They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them." |
| Leviticus 16:10 | "But the goat chosen by lot as the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the Lord to be used for making atonement by sending it into the wilderness as a scapegoat." |

## Key Point 3: Time and Attention: Our Most Precious Offering

In an age of acceleration where "I'm so busy" has become a status symbol, kenosis calls us to offer what is most precious: our time and undivided attention. Just as Elijah offered water in the midst of drought (the most precious resource), we are called to offer slowness, presence, and space in a culture starving for genuine connection.

### Scripture

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Galatians 1:10 | "Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ." |
| Galatians 2:10 | "All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor, the very thing I had been eager to do all along." |

*What is the most precious thing you have to offer? In a world that worships speed, kenosis invites us to slowness, to space freely offered, to presence without agenda.*
