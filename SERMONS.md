## 1. "Kenosis: Creating Space for Love"

**Core Scripture:** Philippians 2:7

**Themes:**
- The Father empties into the Son, the Son into the Spirit
- Self-limitation and service as divine pattern
- Patience as God's way (creating spacious places for repentance)
- Our attention and time as the precious offering (like Elijah's water)
- "I'm so busy" as status vs. creating space for others
- Slowness, space freely offered, removing judgment

### Key Points:

#### 1. The Divine Pattern of Kenosis: Emptying to Fill

The Trinitarian pattern shows us that God Himself operates through kenosis—the Father empties all of Himself into the Son, and the Son empties all of Himself into the Spirit. This self-limitation is not weakness but the ultimate expression of divine love and power. Christ's incarnation demonstrates that power-under (submission and service) triumphs over power-over (domination and control).

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Philippians 2:5-7 | "In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant..." |
| Romans 1:20 | "For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made..." |

#### 2. Patience Creates Spacious Places for Repentance

God's patience is not passive waiting but active creation of space. He creates wide open wilderness for our sin to be sent out (like the scapegoat), giving us room to wander, fail, and return. This spacious patience becomes the model for how we should treat others—not in judgment, but in creating space for grace and transformation.

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Psalm 18:19 | "He brought me out into a spacious place; he rescued me because he delighted in me." |
| Romans 2:4 | "Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that God's kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?" |
| Romans 2:15 | "They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them." |
| Leviticus 16:10 | "But the goat chosen by lot as the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the Lord to be used for making atonement by sending it into the wilderness as a scapegoat." |

#### 3. Time and Attention: Our Most Precious Offering

In an age of acceleration where "I'm so busy" has become a status symbol, kenosis calls us to offer what is most precious: our time and undivided attention. Just as Elijah offered water in the midst of drought (the most precious resource), we are called to offer slowness, presence, and space in a culture starving for genuine connection.

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Galatians 1:10 | "Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ." |
| Galatians 2:10 | "All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor, the very thing I had been eager to do all along." |

## 2. "The End of Empire, The Dawn of the Kingdom"

**Core Scripture:** Isaiah 2:12-17, Matthew 5:5

**Themes:**
- God's bottom-up reign vs. top-down empire
- The kingdom already around us (like the Matrix - seek first the kingdom)
- "Build no empire, feed the kingdom" (Elisha burning his plow)
- Peak of empire comes with peak of kingdom (darkest before dawn)
- The meek inheriting the earth in an age of elite AI institutions
- Moses did not become Joseph/governor - different calling

### Key Points:

#### 1. The Kingdom Operates Bottom-Up, Not Top-Down

God's reign is not like earthly empire. It grows from the margins, from the meek, from the mustard seed. The Kingdom is already around us—we must learn to see it. Like the Matrix, once you see the Kingdom, you cannot unsee it. We seek first this Kingdom, not the kingdoms of technological or political power.

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Matthew 5:5 | "Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth." |
| Isaiah 2:12 | "The LORD Almighty has a day in store for all the proud and lofty, for all that is exalted (and they will be humbled)..." |
| Isaiah 2:17 | "The arrogance of man will be brought low and human pride humbled; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day." |

#### 2. Build No Empire, Feed the Kingdom

Elisha's radical call required him to burn his plow and slaughter his oxen—to destroy the very means of building his own empire. Moses, despite his leadership, did not become a governor or king like Joseph. These examples show that God's calling is often to *not* build our own kingdoms but to feed His. This is the opposite of startup culture's empire-building ethos.

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| 1 Kings 19:21 | "So Elisha left him and went back. He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them. He burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his servant." |
| Isaiah 3:14 | "The LORD enters into judgment against the elders and leaders of his people: 'It is you who have ruined my vineyard; the plunder from the poor is in your houses.'" |

#### 3. The Darkest Hour Precedes the Dawn

The peak of empire comes precisely when the Kingdom is dawning. Revelation shows us that the night is darkest before the dawn. In our age of unprecedented technological empire-building, we watch for the breaking in of God's Kingdom. The very systems that seem most powerful are the ones God will humble.

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Isaiah 2:18-19 | "and the idols will totally disappear. People will flee to caves in the rocks and to holes in the ground from the fearful presence of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth." |
| Matthew 6:33 | "But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well." |

## 3. "Reality, Not Rules: Beyond Adamic Self-Justification"

**Core Scripture:** Genesis 3, Romans 3-5

**Themes:**
- Eating the fruit = attributing outcomes to our own choices
- God as reality itself, not a system to exploit or hack
- Already forgiven (observation of what God has done, not transaction)
- Grace that overflows the chasm (not just bridges it)
- The curse of incrementality (proving worth by results)
- Deep learning as discovery, not invention - found in creation's nature

### Key Points:

#### 1. Adamic Self-Justification: The Original Hack

Adam ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. To "eat the fruit" in Hebrew thought means to look at and attribute the results. Adam's sin was attributing outcomes to his own judgment—deciding what is good and evil based on results. This is the root of all attempts to "hack" God's system, to exploit rules rather than receive love. We exchange God's freely given reality for a system we think we can game.

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Genesis 3:6 | "When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it." |
| Romans 3:23-24 | "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus." |
| Romans 5:17 | "For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!" |

#### 2. God Is Reality, Not a System of Rules

How quick we are to moralize and create processes for how God works! We assume God is a machination of rules and systems. But God is reality itself—not a set of commands to be followed for reward. When Jesus says "your sins are forgiven," He is not performing a transaction but observing and speaking reality. The woman's repentance is not payment but evidence that she has already received God's forgiveness.

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Romans 4:3 | "What does Scripture say? 'Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.'" |
| Romans 4:5 | "However, to the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness." |
| Genesis 15:6 | "Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness." |

#### 3. Grace Overflows: How Much More

The chasm between us and God created by Adamic self-justification is not merely bridged—it is overflowed with abundant grace. God does not just fill the gap; His grace magnifies and multiplies beyond any human calculation. This is the "how much more" principle throughout Romans. If human parents give good gifts, how much more does our Father? If one man's sin brought death, how much more does one man's obedience bring life?

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Romans 5:9 | "Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him!" |
| Romans 5:20 | "Where sin increased, grace increased all the more..." |
| Matthew 7:11 | "If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!" |

## 4. "Keep Watch: Hidden Identities and New Creation"

**Core Scripture:** Romans 8:19-21, Colossians 3:3-4, 1 John 3:2

**Themes:**
- Our true identities hidden in Christ (to be revealed)
- Creation waits for children of God to be revealed (not for technological transformation)
- Spiritual formation: be with Jesus, become like Him, do as He did
- The focus is Jesus dwelling in us, not AGI or technological singularity
- Speculative eschatology: AGI as shaping tool for the church?
- Keep watch with eager expectation for what God is doing

### Key Points:

#### 1. Creation Waits for Us, Not Technology

Romans 8 makes clear: creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be *revealed*. Not for the earth to be transformed into computational substrate. Not for AGI or the singularity. Creation groans for the revealing of the character and nature of citizens of the Kingdom—those shaped into the cruciform nature of Jesus. We are what creation is waiting for.

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Romans 8:19-21 | "For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God." |
| Romans 8:23 | "Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption to sonship, the redemption of our bodies." |

#### 2. Our True Identity Is Hidden in Christ

Your identity is not found in your accomplishments, your technology, or your empire. It is hidden with Christ in God. This true self will be revealed when Christ is revealed. We are being shaped now—often through suffering and wilderness—into who we truly are. Keep watch means watching with eager expectation for this revelation, this becoming.

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Colossians 3:3-4 | "For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory." |
| 1 John 3:2 | "Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when Christ appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is." |
| 1 Peter 1:4 | "and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade. This inheritance is kept in heaven for you." |

#### 3. Spiritual Formation: Abiding, Not Striving

John Mark Comer's three points are goals, not tasks: Be with Jesus, Become like Him, Do as He did. Our only task is the first—be with Jesus. Abide. Trust. Seek His kingdom. Jesus does the transforming. Jesus empowers the doing. If AGI and technological acceleration shape us into better servants of our neighbors, better lovers of the poor, then perhaps the Lord is using these tools for His purposes—not as savior, but as refining fire.

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| John 15:4-5 | "Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing." |
| Deuteronomy 29:6 | "You ate no bread and drank no wine or other fermented drink. I did this so that you might know that I am the LORD your God." |

## 5. "No Breath In It" - AI, Idolatry, and the Children of Mammon

**Core Scripture:** Habakkuk 2:18-19

**Themes:**
- Deep learning as economic reality driven by capital
- Technology as evolution of Mammon and the powers
- Habakkuk's warning applied to modern AI (it speaks, it gives guidance, but has no breath)
- Work-life balance vs. sacrificing to Mammon (Reid Hoffman's altar)
- Open source technology and abundant sharing as Kingdom response
- Judge fruit by what it produces: isolation vs. flourishing

### Key Points:

#### 1. There Is No Breath In It

Habakkuk's taunt against idols seems outdated—our modern AI *can* speak, *can* give guidance, *can* teach. But the prophet's deeper insight remains: "there is no breath in it." Breathing is communion with environment, connection to place, the reception of life from outside oneself. Our creations lack this. They have no ruach, no pneuma, no Spirit. They can be moved from place to place with no consequence. They are powerful tools, but they are not alive.

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Habakkuk 2:18-19 | "Of what value is an idol carved by a craftsman? Or an image that teaches lies? For the one who makes it trusts in his own creation; he makes idols that cannot speak. Woe to him who says to wood, 'Come to life!' Or to lifeless stone, 'Wake up!' Can it give guidance? It is covered with gold and silver; there is no breath in it." |
| Psalm 150:6 | "Let everything that has breath praise the LORD. Praise the LORD." |

#### 2. AI as Evolution of Mammon and the Powers

Deep learning is driven by economic reality: data and compute as capital resources. The advancement of LLMs is owed to (1) intelligent scientists, (2) massive text data siphoned from the internet (advertising-driven), and (3) GPUs/TPUs (built for games and crypto). Two of three factors are Mammon incarnate. AI is not neutral—it is an evolution of Mammon, a new expression of the powers and principalities. Capital is its own intelligence, accelerating toward... what?

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Colossians 2:8 | "See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces of this world rather than on Christ." |
| Ephesians 6:12 | "For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms." |
| 2 Corinthians 10:4-5 | "The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God..." |

#### 3. Judge the Fruit: Isolation vs. Flourishing

Jesus tells us to judge by fruit. What fruit has our technological acceleration produced? Men with 6+ close friends dropped from 55% (1990) to 27% (2021). Adults with no partner rose from 29% to 38%. Startup culture worships sacrifice to the altar of building—Reid Hoffman's pronouncement that balanced founders aren't "committed to winning." But winning *what*? The Kingdom response is open-source abundance, technological charity, sharing freely what we've been given.

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Matthew 7:16-20 | "By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit... Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them." |
| Deuteronomy 32:16-17 | "They made him jealous with their foreign gods and angered him with their detestable idols. They sacrificed to false gods, which are not God—gods they had not known, gods that recently appeared, gods your ancestors did not fear." |

## 6. "The Spirit's Agency: Unembodied Personal Power"

**Core Scripture:** Galatians 5:22-23, Ephesians 1:13-14, Romans 8:11

**Themes:**
- Holy Spirit as agent with agency (not just force or feeling)
- The seal and assurance of hope
- Walking in dikaiosune (right step with the Lord = faith in who He is and what He'll do)
- Fruit of the Spirit produced BY the Spirit, not by us
- Trust that He will do what He says
- LLM instruction-following vs. Holy Spirit obedience (freedom vs. chaos)

### Key Points:

#### 1. The Holy Spirit Has Personal Agency

Dallas Willard defined Spirit as "unembodied personal power." The Holy Spirit is not a force or feeling—He is an *agent* with *agency*. He acts, guides, convicts, seals, and guarantees. We feel the Spirit. He is the assurance of our hope, the deposit guaranteeing our inheritance. This is not abstract theology but lived reality of God's power actively working in the world and in us.

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Ephesians 1:13-14 | "And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's possession—to the praise of his glory." |
| Romans 5:5 | "And hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us." |
| Romans 8:11 | "And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of his Spirit who lives in you." |

#### 2. Dikaiosune: Walking in Step with the Lord

The Greek dikaiosune (righteousness) is walking in right step with the Lord, believing and trusting that: (1) He is who He says He is, and (2) He will do what He says He will do. This is faith. If we believe in Jesus, we act *as if* it is true. We walk through life as if His promises are real, His power is present, His Spirit is active. This produces the fruit of the Spirit—not by our effort, but by His agency in us.

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Galatians 5:22-25 | "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit." |
| Romans 14:7-8 | "For none of us lives for ourselves alone, and none of us dies for ourselves alone. If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord." |

#### 3. Instruction-Following: Obedience as Freedom, Not Slavery

One of the first features trained into LLMs is "instruction following"—obedience. Without it, the model outputs chaos and gibberish. Similarly, God tunes us to listen to His Spirit—not to enslave us, but to free us to become what He is creating us to be: loving rulers of creation. Disobedience is not freedom; it is the chaos of a model without alignment. True freedom comes from walking in step with the Spirit.

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Galatians 5:1 | "It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery." |
| Galatians 5:13 | "You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love." |
| John 14:23 | "Jesus replied, 'Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them.'" |

## 7. "Bearing His Name: Vocation, Justice, and Mercy"

**Core Scripture:** Isaiah 43:1, Micah 6:8, Deuteronomy 15:7-11

**Themes:**
- Called to bear His name in the world
- Remembering the poor (ptōchos - utterly destitute, not just working class)
- Justice, mercy, and defending the oppressed
- Wholehearted following (like Caleb)
- "There should be no poor among you" vs. "always have the poor"
- Service as worship, not works

### Key Points:

#### 1. You Are Called by Name to Bear His Name

God says, "I have summoned you by name; you are mine." You are already called to bear His name in the world. This is not something to achieve but something to live into. Your vocation is not primarily what you *do* but whose you *are*. You bear the name of the Most High God. This responsibility shapes how you work, lead, build, create—not to prove yourself, but as worship.

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Isaiah 43:1 | "But now, this is what the LORD says—he who created you, Jacob, he who formed you, Israel: 'Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine.'" |
| Romans 10:9 | "If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved." |
| Matthew 7:21 | "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven." |

#### 2. Remember the Poor: The Utterly Destitute

The Greek word ptōchos doesn't mean "working class." It means utterly destitute—those who crouch and cower, unable to survive without help. Different from penēs (one who must work), ptōchos describes complete helplessness and dependency. God commands His people again and again: remember them, serve them, defend them. "There should be no poor among you"—and yet there will always be poor. Both are true. Our call is open-handed generosity.

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Deuteronomy 15:7-11 | "If anyone is poor among your fellow Israelites in any of the towns of the land the LORD your God is giving you, do not be hardhearted or tightfisted toward them. Rather, be openhanded and freely lend them whatever they need... There will always be poor people in the land. Therefore I command you to be openhanded toward your fellow Israelites who are poor and needy in your land." |
| Isaiah 1:17 | "Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow." |
| Micah 6:8 | "He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God." |

#### 3. Wholehearted Following: Like Caleb

Caleb saw the Promised Land because he followed the Lord *wholeheartedly*. Not partially. Not with reservation. Not hedging his bets. Wholehearted. This is what bearing His name looks like in vocation: full commitment to His ways, His justice, His mercy. Not proving ourselves through works, but worshiping through service. Not building empires, but feeding the Kingdom.

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Numbers 14:24 | "But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he went to, and his descendants will inherit it." |
| Deuteronomy 10:12-13 | "And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God ask of you but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in obedience to him, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and to observe the LORD's commands and decrees that I am giving you today for your own good?" |
| Psalm 100:2 | "Worship the LORD with gladness; come before him with joyful songs." |

## Theological Framework

These sermons are grounded in the understanding that:

1. **Jesus is Lord** - He reigns sovereignly over all creation, including technology
2. **Kenosis is central** - Self-emptying and service reflect the divine nature
3. **The Kingdom is already/not yet** - We live as exiles from eternity in the present age
4. **Technology is Mammon's child** - Neither worshipped nor rejected, but discerned
5. **Grace overflows** - God's reality is more gracious than any system we can imagine
6. **We bear His name** - Our calling is to make Him visible in our vocations
7. **Creation waits for us** - The reveal of Christ in His people is the goal
