Kenotic

Kenosis. "The Father empties all of himself into the Son. The Son receives and empties all of himself into the Spirit." Kenotic.ai - self limitation and service.


Evil is to be purged and cleansed from creation. Heaven and Earth joined together.
Impurities of being finite beings make us separable to the holiness of God (death, bodily fluids for procreation)
Jesus spoke of reality (first will be last, human relationships, wheat and tares)
Embrace, but don't worship our embodied selves
AI is an evolution of Mammon. Powers and principalities.
The peak of empire comes with the peak of the kingdom. The night is darkest before the dawn. Revelation.
As a contagion of holiness, and a humble servant of grace, Jesus is able to redeem moral impurities and forgiveness. Not because he died, but because of who he is. His death is just the prime, victory, and example of that holy contagion at work.
Do things that don't scale
Already Forgiven. Your sins are forgiven is an expression and observation that God has clearly forgiven the woman
Rules. How quick we are to moralize and make processes for how God works. Even our scientific approach assumes that God is a machination of rules and systems. We exchange the predictive love of our creator for some set of rules that we can hack around and exploit for our own advantage. Isn't this the primary sin? To ignore the love that we receive in the gracious outpouring of gifts in exchange for a system that we can exploit to put ourselves in the position of God? Adam self-justification. Adamic hacks. Adamic exploitation of what we wrongly think is reality. God is reality - not a system of rules. What arrogance to think that we can be the ones to find how to navigate the system of creation? Given this, perhaps, when Jesus speaks of the forgiveness of sin, he is speaking more about the nature of the reality already created, then some kind of exchange or following of process. Perhaps when the woman full of repentance comes to his feet, his statement that her sins have been forgiven is more speaking the reality of what God has already done for her. That he sees her repentance as a sign of the forgiveness she's already received. Not as a payment, but a reflection of the reality that God has already created around her. While Jesus has authority and the Pharisees interpret this as a systematic exchange where he is the one doing the forgiveness, what if instead, Jesus is simply – being the creator who can see all reality as it is – expressing what has already happened from the Father? That her sins are all already forgiven. And her repentance is just a sign that he sees in her of that reality. Read the Bible and Gospels now as if Jesus was merely revealing how nature works to us, not giving a set of commands and a new system of rules.

Ideas and questions
is being "chosen" akin to the Anthropic principle of existence? That I exist therefore I am chosen. As Neil degrasse Tyson has said? Out of all possible humans, I exist because of the Lord and he has chosen us into existence
I think the Lord knew that if Jesus wrote a book, we would revere it too much. Instead His presence and life is what we seek. This is good. His ongoing living presence. Not an artifact.

What would I speak on?
Kenosis — creating space to remove judgement and experience and repay love. Slowness. Space freely offered. Elijah offered the most precious thing he had — water. What is more precious these days than our attention and time? Our time is our status. "I'm so busy" == Status.
End of Empire — God's reign is bottoms up and the Kingdom is like the matrix. It's all around us. Seek first the kingdom which
Atonement — Jesus's power is over the powers. His teachings are to open our eyes to reality.
