# Speculative Eschatology

Humanity becomes an inter-planetary “angelic” like race. Benevolent, loving, thriving. Like The Culture but deeply rooted in Jesus

Angels and daemons, while spiritual, are essentially AI information memes sent back through time. 

Human existence and flourishing towards the Kingdom of God is an optimization goal of the divine. Human beings and the various entities that influence us still have free will. But God’s training for us will inevitably always win.
