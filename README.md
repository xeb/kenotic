# Kenotic.ai

A web experience for sharing personal reflections and sermons about God's work and revelation.

## Project Goals

**Kenotic.ai** is a digital platform for sharing sermons and personal reflections on spiritual growth, divine revelation, and the intersection of faith and technology. The name comes from "Kenosis" - the concept of self-emptying and service, as described in Philippians 2:7.

### Mission

The goal of this project is to work collaboratively with AI systems to help create content and meaningful messages that bring flourishing to the kingdom of God. AI is viewed as a tool in this process - neither worshiped nor rejected, but understood and utilized with discernment. The role of AI itself will be one of the sermon topics.

### Core Themes

The sermons explore deep theological and practical topics including:
- **Kenosis**: Self-limitation, service, and creating space for love
- **End of Empire**: God's bottom-up reign and the kingdom all around us
- **Atonement**: Jesus's power over the powers and principalities
- **AI & Technology**: Understanding AI as an evolution of Mammon and the powers
- **Reality vs. Rules**: God as reality itself, not a system to exploit
- **Forgiveness**: Already given, already present
- **Vocation, Justice, Mercy**: Bearing His name in practical living

## Technical Stack

- **Platform**: Node.js + React web server
- **Deployment**: kenotic.ai

## Design Aesthetic

The visual design should merge the contemplative atmosphere of a monastery with the raw, technical aesthetic of early digital culture.

### Style Direction

**Monastery Meets Terminal**: Think of a monk's cell equipped with a vintage UNIX workstation. The design should evoke:
- The expressive, timeless beauty of monastery architecture
- The stark clarity of old-school UNIX terminals
- The hacker aesthetic of Phrack magazine
- A sense of focused contemplation in a digital space

### Visual Specifications

**Typography**:
- Primary font: **Libre Baskerville** (NOT terminal/monospace fonts)
- Use a classical serif font to maintain the monastery aesthetic
- Typography should be expressive and readable, suitable for long-form content

**Color Palette**:
- Grey (various shades)
- Tan
- Dark brown
- Earth tones that evoke both parchment and vintage CRT displays

**Aesthetic Details**:
- UNIX-inspired UI elements and layouts
- Clean, hierarchical information architecture
- Minimalist but warm
- Text-focused with careful use of whitespace
- Avoid skeuomorphism, but embrace functional brutalism with warmth

### Content Architecture

The site lists sermons and reflections, drawing from source materials stored in the `/sources` directory. Each sermon is a personal reflection on God's work and revelation.

## Sources Directory

The `/sources` folder contains raw materials, notes, and references that inform the content:

- `kenotic_notes.md` - Core theological reflections and sermon concepts
- (Additional sources to be added)

## Development Notes

This README serves as a guide for future development. The implementation should honor both the technical excellence expected in modern web development and the contemplative, sacred nature of the content being shared.
