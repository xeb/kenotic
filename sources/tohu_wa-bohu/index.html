To get close to what we are and what we have chosen to do and what </span><span>He</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span>wants us</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;to become. And to gently and lovingly and humbly point us in a new direction. He worked bottoms up, always. </span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">He never expected this to be a disruptive transformation in a short period of time. No, he called </span><span>the Kingdom</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;a mustard seed whose disruption comes in the fullness of time. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">In God&lsquo;s own time. Therefore, if we are to take the layers of technology that </span><span>H</span><span class="c5">e is generationally giving to us, we must approach our deployment of such technologies into human society in the same way that Jesus does. </span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">With humility by and by diving deep into the </span><span>muck and mire</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;of the </span><span>Kafka-esque</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;bureaucracies that we&rsquo;ve created. It is not good enough nor effective enough to simply say that the bureaucracies are broken and must be thrown away. </span><span>T</span><span class="c9">o do that would be to include in th</span><span>e throwing all</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;the individuals, humans</span><span>, </span><span class="c9">hearts, minds, and soul</span><span>s</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;that we are trying to redeem! No, instead we must embrace</span><span>, endure </span><span class="c9">and </span><span>elevate</span><span class="c9">, but through </span><span>H</span><span class="c9">is </span><span>S</span><span class="c5">pirit.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c35">Embrace</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;the worldly systems as they are. Embrace here means like the prodigal Father embracing his prodigal son. An immediate welcoming and invitation. Embrace here is NOT a support or condoning of Empire&rsquo;s systems. No. It is treating the lady at the DMV as a sister &amp; image bearer. It is knowing that even the managers and executives are flawed humans who have been gifted their positions and need Empire to break just as much as we do.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c35">Endure</span><span>&nbsp;is to patiently sacrifice every day. The broken systems that create human injustice must be endured. For in our own endurance, we put to shame the powers and principalities who think His Spirit could be broken by such evil. To Endure is to condemn the system. We must still call out the injustice and be a prophetic witness of Empire&rsquo;s evil, but we do that </span><span class="c22">through</span><span>&nbsp;our endurance of it. (And of course outward statements as well). I&rsquo;ve come to belief that simply calling out the wrong and injustice while lamenting and patiently enduring is the &ldquo;punk rock&rdquo; work that God wants from us. For He will change the systems. He is the savior who will crush the serpent&rsquo;s head. We are but to endure the serpent&rsquo;s biting while lamenting it is happening. Again, this is not to say there is no action. We can subvert Empire </span><span class="c22">while</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;being submissive. But our focus being on Jesus will enable us to endure it.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c35">Elevate</span><span>&nbsp;is the open breath of cold fresh air the world needs to have. Elevate is to remember that we follow a resurrected God. Who after putting on the lowest form of humanity to show us love and sacrifice, died. But that death was not the end, not even close. His resurrection is the breath of a new creation. The firstfruits of His Spirit working in the world to bring new life. We are called to </span><span class="c35">elevate </span><span class="c5">the human experience. To stand apart. To be holy. To be an outpost sign in a war that has already been won. To echo that His Kingdom has come and is coming and we can seek and be in it now. That his Kingship is above all other powers and principalities that we may find in this world.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c10 c9"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c28">Not a Set of Rules </span><span class="c28">Sep 18, 2025</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c9 c10"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">A Christian is someone who wakes early to eagerly pray, to seek, to read, and be with Jesus.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>An apprentice </span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c3"><span class="c28">A Respite of Repentance </span><span class="c28">Aug 30, 2025</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c10 c9"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">I&rsquo;ve yet again neglected this work.
