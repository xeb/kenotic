# The End of Empire, The Dawn of the Kingdom

**Core Scripture:** Isaiah 2:12-17, Matthew 5:5

## Key Point 1: The Kingdom Operates Bottom-Up, Not Top-Down

God's reign is not like earthly empire. It grows from the margins, from the meek, from the mustard seed. The Kingdom is already around us—we must learn to see it. Like the Matrix, once you see the Kingdom, you cannot unsee it. We seek first this Kingdom, not the kingdoms of technological or political power.

| Isaiah 2:12 | "The LORD Almighty has a day in store for all the proud and lofty, for all that is exalted (and they will be humbled)..." |
| Isaiah 2:17 | "The arrogance of man will be brought low and human pride humbled; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day." |

## Key Point 2: Build No Empire, Feed the Kingdom

Elisha's radical call required him to burn his plow and slaughter his oxen—to destroy the very means of building his own empire. Moses, despite his leadership, did not become a governor or king like Joseph. These examples show that God's calling is often to *not* build our own kingdoms but to feed His. This is the opposite of startup culture's empire-building ethos.

### Scripture

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| 1 Kings 19:21 | "So Elisha left him and went back. He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them. He burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his servant." |
| Isaiah 3:14 | "The LORD enters into judgment against the elders and leaders of his people: 'It is you who have ruined my vineyard; the plunder from the poor is in your houses.'" |

## Key Point 3: The Darkest Hour Precedes the Dawn

The peak of empire comes precisely when the Kingdom is dawning. Revelation shows us that the night is darkest before the dawn. In our age of unprecedented technological empire-building, we watch for the breaking in of God's Kingdom. The very systems that seem most powerful are the ones God will humble.

### Scripture

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Isaiah 2:18-19 | "and the idols will totally disappear. People will flee to caves in the rocks and to holes in the ground from the fearful presence of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth." |
| Matthew 6:33 | "But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well." |

*How do the meek inherit an earth dominated by technological power? What does it mean to "build no empire" in our daily work? The Kingdom is all around us—seek first this Kingdom.*
