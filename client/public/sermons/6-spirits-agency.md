# The Spirit's Agency: Unembodied Personal Power

**Core Scripture:** Galatians 5:22-23, Ephesians 1:13-14, Romans 8:11

## Key Point 1: The Holy Spirit Has Personal Agency

Dallas Willard defined Spirit as "unembodied personal power." The Holy Spirit is not a force or feeling—He is an *agent* with *agency*. He acts, guides, convicts, seals, and guarantees. We feel the Spirit. He is the assurance of our hope, the deposit guaranteeing our inheritance. This is not abstract theology but lived reality of God's power actively working in the world and in us.

### Scripture

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Ephesians 1:13-14 | "And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's possession—to the praise of his glory." |
| Romans 5:5 | "And hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us." |
| Romans 8:11 | "And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of his Spirit who lives in you." |

## Key Point 2: Dikaiosune: Walking in Step with the Lord

The Greek dikaiosune (righteousness) is walking in right step with the Lord, believing and trusting that: (1) He is who He says He is, and (2) He will do what He says He will do. This is faith. If we believe in Jesus, we act *as if* it is true. We walk through life as if His promises are real, His power is present, His Spirit is active. This produces the fruit of the Spirit—not by our effort, but by His agency in us.

### Scripture

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Galatians 5:22-25 | "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit." |
| Romans 14:7-8 | "For none of us lives for ourselves alone, and none of us dies for ourselves alone. If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord." |

## Key Point 3: Instruction-Following: Obedience as Freedom, Not Slavery

One of the first features trained into LLMs is "instruction following"—obedience. Without it, the model outputs chaos and gibberish. Similarly, God tunes us to listen to His Spirit—not to enslave us, but to free us to become what He is creating us to be: loving rulers of creation. Disobedience is not freedom; it is the chaos of a model without alignment. True freedom comes from walking in step with the Spirit.

### Scripture

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Galatians 5:1 | "It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery." |
| Galatians 5:13 | "You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love." |
| John 14:23 | "Jesus replied, 'Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them.'" |

*Do we trust the Holy Spirit's personal agency in our lives? What's the difference between striving for fruit vs. abiding in the vine? Obedience is freedom.*
