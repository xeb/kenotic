        I imbued you with zeal for me.

        Habakkuk 2:18-19 - "Of what value is an idol carved by a craftsman? Or an image that teaches lies? For the one who makes it trusts in his own creation; he makes idols that cannot speak. Woe to him who says to wood, 'Come to life!' Or to lifeless stone, 'Wake up!' Can it give guidance? It is covered with gold and silver; there is no breath in it."

        Romans 2:23 - "You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?"

        Romans 2:25 - "Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised."

        There is no breath in it for His creation works through power under.

        Romans starts by condemning the "other" then in 2 flips it - how can you judge? (v4) - [BIG?]

        I got angry at someone for reserving a car charger. Then found out I was that person's skip.

        Read this & repented.

        Patience as a way of God yields repentance.

        Romans 2:15 - "They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them."

        No one does good

        Leviticus 16:15 - "He shall then slaughter the goat for the sin offering for the people and take its blood behind the curtain and do with it as he did with the bull's blood: He shall sprinkle it on the atonement cover and in front of it."

        Galatians 3:6 - "So also Abraham 'believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.'"

        → Goat in the wilderness

        Psalm 18:19 - "He brought me out into a spacious place; he rescued me because he delighted in me."

        To the devious you are shrewd

        If I try to please people, I am NOT a servant of God.

        Galatians 1:10 - "Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ."

        Paul claims he was not taught.

        Continue to remember the poor.

        Do not provoke

        Fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23):
        - Love (the whole of the Law)
        - Joy
        - Peace
        - Forbearance/Patience
        - Kindness
        - Goodness
        - Faithfulness
        - Gentleness
        - Self-control

        HS is an AGENT He has AGENCY.

        The HS is reliable and a seal of that hope.

        We feel the Spirit.

        Assurance of the hope.

        Ephesians 1:14 - "who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's possession—to the praise of his glory."

        Walking in/Aligning step with the Lord (dikaiosune) is believing, trusting and having FAITH that:
        - He is who He says
        - Will do what He promises

        "You will circle life"
        - this was separate from the building. It was growth.

        Glory in our sufferings because we know that suffering produces:
        - perseverance per severance
        - character
        - hope

        Hope does NOT put us to shame because God's love has poured into our hearts through HS who has been given to us

        How much MORE grace will the Lord pour out compared to the death from Adam.

        Life & Grace

        Life > death

        Buried w/ Christ through Baptism

        1 Peter 1:4 - "and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade. This inheritance is kept in heaven for you,"

        The inheritance is kept in Heaven until the Coming of the Salvation READY to be REVEALED

        Elijah was Zealous

        Trust the King

        by taking up your cross

        what are you asking of me?

        Help, Support, Sacrifice

        Slave to holiness

        Give up (literally) all you have and follow

        1 Kings 19:21 - "So Elisha left him and went back. He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them. He burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his servant."

        What does this mean for me? I have not slaughtered my oxen, not burnt my plow - are you asking me that Lord?

        Build No Empire

        Feed My Kingdom

        You are already called to bear My Name.

        Isaiah 43:1 - "But now, this is what the LORD says— he who created you, Jacob, he who formed you, Israel: 'Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine.'"

        Don't deceive yourself it's not easy and that's OK. You do not stand condemned and nothing can separate or cut off the love from Christ.

        Jesus is Lord

        Romans 10:9 - "If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."

        vs

        Matthew 7:21 - "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven."

        Be the one who does His will.

        - Love
        - Faith
        - Hope

        Open up to His Grace

        He did!

        I answered my prayer

        I have hope.

        Give what is owed

        Respect & Honor

        Clothe ourselves in Jesus

        Romans 14:7-8 - "For none of us lives for ourselves alone, and none of us dies for ourselves alone. If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord."

        Live for the Lord

        Die for the Lord

        Daniel 1:17 - "To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning. And Daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds."

        Hear me Lord!

        My interpretation:
        - Do not solve Support myself Let the Law go ahead
        - Offer peace or an arrangement to GBO
        - Trust the Lord when it is time to fight

        Caleb will see it because he followed WHOLEHEARTEDLY

        ? the Lord was angry w/Moses because of Israel?

        Do not fight

        I am going ahead of you

        You have not lacked anything

        The "fighting men" were eliminated from the camp.

        It is He that gives the ability to produce wealth and so confirms His covenant.

        It is their wickedness that they are driven of

        NOT your righteousness

        - never revealed Judas
        - probably acknowledged him

        John 14:23 - "Jesus replied, 'Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them.'"

        If you love Jesus you will obey His teachings and He will come to you.

        Peace he gives but not as the world does

        Do not ALLOW your hearts to be troubled and do not be afraid.

        Proof of the world comes so that the world knows that Jesus loves the Father

        Enjoy the writing

        The Father's glory came to Jesus through the Church

        John 17:10 - "All I have is yours, and all you have is mine. And glory has come to me through them."

        John 17:22 - "I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one."

        The Father's name is the name He gave Jesus
        → Protects us by His name?

        Dream: "Get out of the metrg"

        Unity & Communion w/ Jesus & the Father

        Our present suffering mirrors in small and bearable ways the suffering that Jesus endured - so that we may know He loves us and our sanctified in Him

        He looks for justice

        Isaiah 5:8 - "Woe to you who add house to house and join field to field till no space is left and you live alone in the land."

        Lambs will feed in the ruins of the rich

        Isaiah 6:2 - "Above him were seraphim, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying."

        Seraphim covered faces like Ezekiel?

        If you do not stand firm in your Faith you will not stand.

        (Lost my other one)

        I think God is trying to tell me that His words on my heart matter MORE than this new ritual

        Shout for Joy to the Lord all the Earth

        Worship w/ Gladness

        Come before Him with joyful Songs

        Know that the Lord is God

        Only the Lord is grading me.
