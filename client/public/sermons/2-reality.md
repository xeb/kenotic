# Reality, Not Rules: Beyond Adamic Self-Justification

**Core Scripture:** Genesis 3, Romans 3-5

## Key Point 1: Adamic Self-Justification: The Original Hack

Adam ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. To "eat the fruit" in Hebrew thought means to look at and attribute the results. Adam's sin was attributing outcomes to his own judgment—deciding what is good and evil based on results. This is the root of all attempts to "hack" God's system, to exploit rules rather than receive love. We exchange God's freely given reality for a system we think we can game.

### Scripture

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Genesis 3:6 | "When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it." |
| Romans 3:23-24 | "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus." |
| Romans 5:17 | "For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!" |

## Key Point 2: God Is Reality, Not a System of Rules

How quick we are to moralize and create processes for how God works! We assume God is a machination of rules and systems. But God is reality itself—not a set of commands to be followed for reward. When Jesus says "your sins are forgiven," He is not performing a transaction but observing and speaking reality. The woman's repentance is not payment but evidence that she has already received God's forgiveness.

### Scripture

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Romans 4:3 | "What does Scripture say? 'Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.'" |
| Romans 4:5 | "However, to the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness." |
| Genesis 15:6 | "Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness." |

## Key Point 3: Grace Overflows: How Much More

The chasm between us and God created by Adamic self-justification is not merely bridged—it is overflowed with abundant grace. God does not just fill the gap; His grace magnifies and multiplies beyond any human calculation. This is the "how much more" principle throughout Romans. If human parents give good gifts, how much more does our Father? If one man's sin brought death, how much more does one man's obedience bring life?

### Scripture

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Romans 5:9 | "Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him!" |
| Romans 5:20 | "Where sin increased, grace increased all the more..." |
| Matthew 7:11 | "If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!" |

*Are we trying to exploit God's system or receive His love? The curse of incrementality—proving worth by results—is the lie of Adamic self-justification. God is reality, freely given.*
