# Relationships

God is relational

But so is the nature of creation. 

Creation echoes this aspect of God.

“In our models of physics, we begin by considering spatial hypergraphs that describe relations between ‘atoms of space’. Then, looking at all possible ways a given rule can update these hypergraphs, we form what we call a multiway graph. ... Instead of just forming a multiway graph in which we do all possible updates with a given rule, we form a rulial multiway (or ‘ultramultiway’) graph in which we follow not only all possible updates, but also all possible rules. The transversals to this rulial multiway graph define what we call rulial space.”
- Stephen Wolfram

Key Definitions
• Hypergraph: In this model, the hypergraph represents space itself. It’s a collection of abstract points (“atoms of space”) and the relations between them. The entire state of the universe at one instant is one massive hypergraph.  
• Branchial Space: This space maps the relationships between different possible quantum histories. As the rules for updating the hypergraph are applied, many possible paths (or “branches”) are created; branchial space is the map of how these different branches are entangled and related to one another.  
• Rulial Space: This is the most abstract space. It is the space of all possible rules that could be used to update the hypergraph. The “ruliad” is the entangled limit of all possible computations from all possible rules, and rulial space is the map of this ultimate structure.
