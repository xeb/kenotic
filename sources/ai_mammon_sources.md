## Statistics on Social Isolation

- [Tweet: Social isolation statistics](https://x.com/aakashg0/status/1983425315352522847)
  - Reference for data on declining friendships and increasing isolation in the age of technology

## Key Themes

- AI as evolution of Mammon
- Deep learning driven by economic reality (data + compute as capital)
- Technology's fruit: isolation vs. flourishing
- The breathless nature of AI (no ruach, pneuma, Spirit)
- Startup culture and empire-building vs. Kingdom-building

## The Bitter Lesson: General Computation Wins

Richard Sutton's "The Bitter Lesson" (2019) observes that in AI research, general methods that leverage computation consistently outperform methods that leverage human knowledge and domain expertise. The two most powerful general methods: **search** and **learning**.

### The Bitter Lesson Applied to Humans

**The same principle applies to human beings and spiritual formation.**

Just as general-purpose computation scales better than hand-coded heuristics, humans—as general learners with search and learning capabilities—are fundamentally more valuable than narrow optimization for specific tasks. We are not mere production functions to be optimized for efficiency. We are bearers of the image of God, general intelligences created for relationship, creativity, and dominion.

**God's approach is also deeply "general":**

- **Grace over Law**: Simple, general principles (love God, love neighbor) triumph over complex rule systems. The Pharisees optimized for specific behaviors; Jesus offered general truth.
- **Reality over Rules**: God is reality itself, not a system of heuristics to exploit. The "general computation" of abiding in Christ outperforms the hand-coded optimizations of self-justification.
- **Search + Learning**: Spiritual formation is about searching (seeking the Kingdom) and learning (being transformed by the Spirit), not about executing pre-programmed behaviors.

The bitter lesson for startup culture and Mammon: **humans are not production functions**. The most efficient form of general computation for flourishing is not scaling venture-backed empires, but cultivating souls—slow, patient, relational, Spirit-led transformation.

The Kingdom operates on general principles that scale infinitely: kenosis, grace, mercy, love. These "general methods" that leverage the Spirit's power will always outperform the hand-coded heuristics of empire, optimization, and self-justification.
