# Wilderness Notes - March 25 to May 3, 2025

## 2025-03-25 Day 1

![Header](day1_title.jpg) | ![Content](day1_content.jpg)

I imbued you with zeal for me.

**Habakkuk 2:18-19** - _"Of what value is an idol carved by a craftsman? Or an image that teaches lies? For the one who makes it trusts in his own creation; he makes idols that cannot speak. Woe to him who says to wood, 'Come to life!' Or to lifeless stone, 'Wake up!' Can it give guidance? It is covered with gold and silver; there is no breath in it."_

**Romans 2:23** - _"You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?"_

**Romans 2:25** - _"Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised."_

There is no breath in it for His creation works through power under.

Romans starts by condemning the "other" then in 2 flips it - how can you judge? (v4) - [BIG?]

## 2025-03-26 Day 2

![Header](day2_title.jpg) | ![Content](day2_content.jpg)

I got angry at someone for reserving a car charger. Then found out I was that person's skip.

Read this & repented.

Patience as a way of God yields repentance.

**Romans 2:15** - _"They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them."_

No one does good

**Leviticus 16:15** - _"He shall then slaughter the goat for the sin offering for the people and take its blood behind the curtain and do with it as he did with the bull's blood: He shall sprinkle it on the atonement cover and in front of it."_

**Galatians 3:6** - _"So also Abraham 'believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.'"_

→ Goat in the wilderness

**Psalm 18:19** - _"He brought me out into a spacious place; he rescued me because he delighted in me."_

To the devious you are shrewd

## 2025-03-27 Day 3

![Header](day3_title.jpg) | ![Content](day3_content.jpg)

If I try to please people, I am NOT a servant of God.

**Galatians 1:10** - _"Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ."_

Paul claims he was not taught.

Continue to remember the poor.

Do not provoke

**Fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23):**
- Love (the whole of the Law)
- Joy
- Peace
- Forbearance/Patience
- Kindness
- Goodness
- Faithfulness
- Gentleness
- Self-control

## 2025-03-28 Day 4

![Content 1](day4_content1.jpg) | ![Content 2](day4_content2.jpg)

HS is an AGENT He has AGENCY.

The HS is reliable and a seal of that hope.

We feel the Spirit.

Assurance of the hope.

**Ephesians 1:14** - _"who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's possession—to the praise of his glory."_

Walking in/Aligning step with the Lord (dikaiosune) is believing, trusting and having FAITH that:
- He is who He says
- Will do what He promises

"You will circle life"
- this was separate from the building. It was growth.

Glory in our sufferings because we know that suffering produces:
- perseverance per severance
- character
- hope

Hope does NOT put us to shame because God's love has poured into our hearts through HS who has been given to us

How much MORE grace will the Lord pour out compared to the death from Adam.

Life & Grace

Life > death

Buried w/ Christ through Baptism

**1 Peter 1:4** - _"and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade. This inheritance is kept in heaven for you,"_

The inheritance is kept in Heaven until the Coming of the Salvation READY to be REVEALED

## 2025-03-31 Day 7

![Header](day7_title.jpg) | ![Content](day7_content.jpg)

Slave to holiness

Give up (literally) all you have and follow

**1 Kings 19:21** - _"So Elisha left him and went back. He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them. He burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his servant."_

What does this mean for me? I have not slaughtered my oxen, not burnt my plow - are you asking me that Lord?

Build No Empire

Feed My Kingdom

## 2025-04-01 Day 8

![Header](day8_title.jpg) | ![Content](day8_content.jpg)

You are already called to bear My Name.

**Isaiah 43:1** - _"But now, this is what the LORD says— he who created you, Jacob, he who formed you, Israel: 'Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine.'"_

Don't deceive yourself it's not easy and that's OK. You do not stand condemned and nothing can separate or cut off the love from Christ.

Respect & Honor

Live for the Lord

Die for the Lord

**Daniel 1:17** - _"To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning. And Daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds."_

My interpretation:

? the Lord was angry w/Moses because of Israel?

Do not fight

Daniel remained. (cont)

The knowledge was a response to prayer. And to injustice!

Your free offerings are to be enjoyed before the Lord - thus we worship

Do not neglect the Levites

**Deuteronomy 12:20** - _"When the LORD your God has enlarged your territory as he promised you, and you crave meat and say, 'I would like some meat,' then you may eat as much of it as you want."_

Annoying God w/ created idols (that start worship)

**Deuteronomy 31:20** - _"When I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, the land I promised on oath to their ancestors, and when they eat their fill and thrive, they will turn to other gods and worship them, rejecting me and breaking my covenant."_

Lambs will feed in the ruins of the rich

**Isaiah 6:2** - _"Above him were seraphim, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying."_
