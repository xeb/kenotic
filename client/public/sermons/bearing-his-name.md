# Bearing His Name: Vocation, Justice, and Mercy

**Core Scripture:** Isaiah 43:1, Micah 6:8, Deuteronomy 15:7-11

## Key Point 1: You Are Called by Name to Bear His Name

God says, "I have summoned you by name; you are mine." You are already called to bear His name in the world. This is not something to achieve but something to live into. Your vocation is not primarily what you *do* but whose you *are*. You bear the name of the Most High God. This responsibility shapes how you work, lead, build, create—not to prove yourself, but as worship.

### Scripture

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Isaiah 43:1 | "But now, this is what the LORD says—he who created you, Jacob, he who formed you, Israel: 'Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine.'" |
| Romans 10:9 | "If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved." |
| Matthew 7:21 | "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven." |

## Key Point 2: Remember the Poor: The Utterly Destitute

The Greek word ptōchos doesn't mean "working class." It means utterly destitute—those who crouch and cower, unable to survive without help. Different from penēs (one who must work), ptōchos describes complete helplessness and dependency. God commands His people again and again: remember them, serve them, defend them. "There should be no poor among you"—and yet there will always be poor. Both are true. Our call is open-handed generosity.

### Scripture

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Deuteronomy 15:7-11 | "If anyone is poor among your fellow Israelites in any of the towns of the land the LORD your God is giving you, do not be hardhearted or tightfisted toward them. Rather, be openhanded and freely lend them whatever they need... There will always be poor people in the land. Therefore I command you to be openhanded toward your fellow Israelites who are poor and needy in your land." |
| Isaiah 1:17 | "Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow." |
| Micah 6:8 | "He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God." |

## Key Point 3: Wholehearted Following: Like Caleb

Caleb saw the Promised Land because he followed the Lord *wholeheartedly*. Not partially. Not with reservation. Not hedging his bets. Wholehearted. This is what bearing His name looks like in vocation: full commitment to His ways, His justice, His mercy. Not proving ourselves through works, but worshiping through service. Not building empires, but feeding the Kingdom.

### Scripture

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Numbers 14:24 | "But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he went to, and his descendants will inherit it." |
| Deuteronomy 10:12-13 | "And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God ask of you but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in obedience to him, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and to observe the LORD's commands and decrees that I am giving you today for your own good?" |
| Psalm 100:2 | "Worship the LORD with gladness; come before him with joyful songs." |

*What does it mean to bear God's name in our vocation? How do we serve the utterly destitute in an age of abundance? Wholehearted following—not building empires, but feeding the Kingdom.*
