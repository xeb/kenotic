# Kenotic Landing Quotes

Three meditative quotes for the scrollable landing presentation.

## Quote 1: The Cross

"I asked the Lord to reveal Himself.

I asked to see Him more clearly. 

I asked to behold His divine nature.

Why is it that I am surprised to then stare at a cross?"

## Quote 2: The Kingdom

"

The Kingdom is already around us. Once you see it as a manifestation of Him, you cannot unsee it. 

Build no empire, feed the Kingdom.

## Quote 3: Grace and Reality

"God is reality itself, not a system or set of rules to exploit. 

When Jesus says 'your sins are forgiven,' He observes reality—grace already overflowing.

Jesus is relational reality.
