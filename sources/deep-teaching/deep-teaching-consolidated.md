# Deep Teaching

Jesus Christ is enthroned as King over creation, being one with the Father, and present in the world through His Holy Spirit.

> "One does not philosophize to amuse oneself, nor even to better understand the world . . . but sometimes literally to 'save one's skin.'"
> — Luc Ferry

My hope is this book (and the process of writing it) helps articulate the experienced nuances of being a follower of Jesus in the age of AI.

## Purpose

I'm writing this as a way (for at least me) to refine a Jesus centered path through the age of artificial intelligence. As a way to ask the Spirit for discernment for what will come. This book will take the posture of speaking to the Church. <nothing can stand against us>.

So Lord, my prayer is that this exercise help at least this humble author act as Jesus would amidst this flurry of accelerating technology. My ask is that we do not be conformed to the world and its message of "pending AGI" but be transformed by the renewing of our minds centered on you, Jesus. Teach us how to approach this particular subject in the same manner you have emboldened your chosen to deal with any other subject. With mercy, compassion and being slow to anger.

### Does God Like Robots?

- Not all robots
- a dumb question that gets to the heart of things…
- Tower of Babel
  https://christoverall.com/article/concise/the-tower-of-babel-and-the-ideology-of-ai/
    - Technologies that are opposed to God's will or plans are thwarted
    - God's plan was to spread humanity, to live in commune with God and proclaim His name — the peoples on the plains of Shinar disobeyed each of those

### Deep Learning

- Primer on modern day deep learning
- We will use the Transformer (the model architecture behind ChatGPT's GPT and o-family models, Google Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, etc.) and Reinforcement Learning to show how deep learning can offer a new framework for understanding the ancient patterns of God
- This is not any new revelation

### Infused with Spirituality

- our technology is infused with spirituality and spiritual language
    - Daemons
    - AGI / Superintelligence
    - Heavenly Host
    - Eternal Life through biotechnology
    - Ascension through mind uploading
- What if this is our modern Tower of Babel?
- Is the desire to "ascend" through our own means wrong? When it is without God, yes. The Church is meant to stand as a prophetic witness against that which is not of God
- God can use anything for his purposes, so what is God doing with modern technology?
    - He has not stopped it, yet
    - It is creating benefits, but also evils
    - Secularism is on the rise

### Garden City

- Focus on What is Good
- Machines of Loving Grace
- Creation waits in expectation
- Lions and sheep at peace
- No more death
- What was creation supposed to be?
- If technological this implies an end state far advanced

    - Nick Land Quotes
- Flesh: End of Death (Brian, Bostrom's Essay)
    - Shared goal! Death is the enemy of love
- Devil: Memetic Warfare

### Obey Your Masters

- Work hard for Jesus
- Do Not Do Evil
    - Paul and Peter assumed that harsh masters had innocuous tasks
- Don't Quiet Your Moral Compass

### Speculations

- Accelerationism is a fear of death
- God and Jesus are definitely NOT future instantiations of AI. My ways are not your ways. Also: what outcome or logical conclusion happens if we think this? What outcome happens if we do NOT? Consequential thinking
- Christianity from the anthropic principle. Is it just the result of thousands of years of optimization? (No, just based on the historical accounts. The sudden flourishing)
- Logos as Greek philosophy. Take every thought and make it captive to Christ
- Speed demon
- LLMs can teach us about our own human biases. We regurgitate what we were trained with. We become what we follow.
- Future Bodies: Can't live without a limbic system?
    - Resurrected Jesus ate
    - What is best in life?
    - Bodies that can apperate

**Journey Before Destination**

The world around us is accelerating with technological change. New inventions, discoveries, and paradigm shifting ideas seem to come at us daily. The rate at which these changes are introduced to us also seems to be getting faster. Large language model (LLM) capabilities are improving at exponential rates; even in the midst of economic upheaval. The AI systems that use such LLMs are already coding themselves with an ever diminishing amount of humans in the loop. In a short amount of time, many experts and industry builders believe that AI will be able to self-improve with a skeleton crew of human involvement. The meme is "when will the first billion dollar company be created by a single individual?"

What is a follower of Jesus to make of this? An age of relentless computation power is before us. Is there still room for a teacher who is lowly, humble and promises an easy yoke?

This book is a personal journey based on that question. It is a reflection on the state of technological change for a follower of Jesus. By covering a series of questions, my hope is the Spirit reveals insights about what it means to be in a world of AI-driven acceleration, but not "of it." Is it possible to use AI, build AI, or see AI as good for humanity if you follow Jesus? If you believe the Sermon on the Mount that "blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth" - how does that correlate to a world where elite corporate institutions and a select few individuals hold the power of our largest intelligence systems with ever increasing capabilities to change the economical environment for everyone on earth? How do the meek inherit *that* type of  earth?

Let us ask these questions to our Teacher. We follow Jesus's deep teaching into an age of artificial general intelligence (or "AGI").

It is worth saying that every "age" is God's. His sovereignty is clear in the Biblical accounts even if not every event originates from the divine.

**There Is No Breath In It**

In February 2025, I built a prototype that would become a real product and be announced after 4 short (but furious) months. After spending a weekend hacking on a prototype, I was struck with how *game changing* the experience of interacting with an AI that had the ability to see, hear, talk, and act — seemingly on its own. The product itself is a result of thousands of individuals working hard. The "secret sauce" is really just Gemini 2.5 Pro -- the large language model that Google released and  is considered one of the best in the world (as of this writing). Please do not get me wrong: there are hundreds of individuals that are responsible for the product more than I am. But I want to recap this prototyping experience because I vividly remember the "seed" of the agentic technology before it flourished.

At the time when the prototype was made, GPT-4o, Claude, and other AI technologies were already mainstream. Like many people, I had expectations about what AI assistants could do and what they were useful for. But this time, it was different for me. A week after building the proof of concept, I was led to a particular Bible verse. Specifically from the prophet Habakkuk who says (in 2:18-19 NIV): "of what value is an idol carved by a craftsman? Or an image that teaches lies? For the one who makes it trusts in his own creation; he makes idols that cannot speak. Woe to him who says to wood, 'Come to life!' Or to lifeless stone, 'Wake up!' Can it give guidance? It is covered with gold and silver; there is no breath in it."

Yikes! How's that for the Word speaking across centuries into present life! A little on the nose, Jesus.

What was most striking to me about being lead to this passage and seeing the prototype "come to life": was that the creation I had cobbled together was **indeed** speaking. It had voice interaction. Like Alexa or Siri or other assistants -- I was speaking to silicon. And those voice assistant "idols" can definitely give guidance! Sometimes the advice I get from Gemini is *top quality* better than 90% of humans! Personalized, grounded in social sciences, and carefully constructed to not break down my fragile psyche.

Can you imagine what the prophets of old would say about ChatGPT! How would Habakkuk phrase his taunt to the idols of our Modern Computational Empire seeing what we have today? Our modern AI does the things they said idols could never do! The religious warnings about our own creations are not up to date — even if they are still true. (More on that later)

But Habakkuk was on to something too.

"There is no breath in it."

One of the definitions of life in the anicent mind was what modern people know as the process of inhaling nitrogen, oxygen, and the air of the earth to oxygenate our blood and give life to the process that exists within our bodies. Breathing. What is interesting about breathing is that it is an ingestion and communion with the environment itself. It is not possible to breathe in space. (You can't speak in space either). To be alive is in many ways to be connected to the environment. Our modern creations have very loose connections with their environments.

Our creation, my prototype, the idol that is Alexa sitting in my house -- none of them can breathe. It can also be moved from house to house with no consequence. It lacks life. It lacks breathe. Now I'm not saying that respiration is the definition of life -- just calling out that we are still far, far away from the boundary of idol vs. life set by the prophets.

The bigger question was: is God telling me that I am creating an idol? Am I worshipping false gods?

**False Gods Lead to Sovereign Ruin**

Like each generation before us, we face new existential crises. The rampant expansion of technology across multiple industries is unique in terms of "crises". Unique because it is directly within our control as a species and the risk/reward of such growth is so opaque. Or as the great philosopher Jerry Seinfeld puts it: "we are smart enough to build AI, dumb enough to need it, and so stupid that we can't figure out if we did the right thing."

The idea of rampant technological growth has been called "Effective Accelerationism" or "e/acc" - although that term may be a bit out dated.

The term "Accelerationism" comes from a philosopher named Nick Land. He argues that capital itself is its own artificial intelligence and that the nature of capital is to grow and expand. In Land's mind this continuous growth could lead to the extinction of humanity. The technological growth built around the optimization of "accumulate capital" would eventually accelerate to an alien intelligence that consumes the cosmos — or perhaps at least earth. Or to be it best in Land's own words: "Nothing human makes it out of the near-future." This emergent AI certainly would not **have breath** in the poetic sense.

To refine this idea (or at least make it less depressing), Guillaume Verdon added the word "Effective" borrowing from the (arguably failed) movement of Effective Altruism. The "Effective"-ness means that the process of Nick Land's acceleration is **directed** (as in it is **effective** at achieving a goal). This goal is the thriving of **humans** — not an alien capital-consuming AI. However, the definition of what is **human** is fluid to some e/acc enthusiasts. The reason Effective Accelerationism or e/acc is an important modern concept is that it advocates for the relentless building of technology and usage of energy to achieve humanity's greatest potential. (Which sounds cool, right?)

**The Fruit of False Teaching**

You may not agree with the premise of the above philosophies, but we must wrestle with the fact they exist as modern day idealogies. One might call them modern "powers and principalities." The **individuals building the technology** seem to gravitate to these philosophies too. (At least I do). We should take a quick glance of the fruit produced by our current technological progress.

- The percentage of Men with 6 or more close friends has fallen from 55% in 1990 to 27% in 2021.
- The percentage of adults who have no "partner" has increased from 29% in 1990 to 38% in 2018.

These are hardly newsworthy stats. We all know and feel that technological growth has increased feelings of isolation and come at the cost of community. While the philosophies previously mentioned are unlikely to be the root cause of these outcomes, the philosophies of rampant technological acceleration produce the same fruit that we see at a societal scale. A culture constantly connected, but plagued with isolation.

These trends are not improving. Deeper philosophies within "big tech" steer into this trend. Memes like being "cracked" or "locked-in" where the elite startup founders live in isolation and build relentlessly are continously celebrated. Start-up culture worships the very essence of sacrificing one's own life in the pursuit of creating something with one's own hands. Tech is eating the fruits of -- or self-justifying -- the work of their hands. The work that comes from their own knowledge about what is right or wrong. This is pure idolatry as defined by the Bible, but yet… it works! Unlike a golden calf that just sits there or a wooden statue that cannot give Habakkuk the life guidance he may want.

The technology of today actually delivers! But as we see -- at the cost of human life.

**The Only Way Out Is Through**

If we believe that Jesus the Son of God sits at the right hand of the Father and who sovereignly reigns over this Earth through His Spirit in the church — then how do we reconcile and approach a cadre of belief around technological acceleration? Especially when these advancements are coming into material existence at a rapid pace. Technological acceleration is physical and material process that is up-ending human experience in ways unimagined. Does Jesus still reign at the center of it?

He does.

Let's tackle these questions in six chapters. I am a fan of pithy titles, so each chapter is a command we find in Scripture. Then I will leave room (as in the missing "seventh chapter") for you to rest or dwell with Jesus in the knowledge and hope that he is still the King of this world. That he reamins our Shepherd, and that we already lack nothing in the Kingdom he has already established.

**First: Be Fruitful and Multiply**. This chapter will explain what deep learning is and how it works. "AI" is a broad term, but I will typically refer to deep learning and transformer models when using it. This chapter is technical. The core hypothesis we need to establish is that deep learning is directly tied to economics. That money and how capital functions is the reason this particular way of building intelligence has and will continue to thrive in the world.

**Second: Give To God**. With a reasonable framework for talking about AI, we will then look at what Jesus has to say about AI. And yes I believe Jesus's *does* have wisdom about AI. Like all areas of human experience, we can learn from our Teacher. We will explore some common parables, teachings, and see how they can relate to AI.

**Third: Keep Watch**. The New Testament articulates a coming age of "New Creation" that sounds a lot like the argument in Part 1 or the Effective Acceleration end state. Is this "New Creation" just an ancient way for describing the Singularity? Did ancient writers envision something else? This chapter will try to see how an orthodox eschatology (a fancy way of saying "end times") can fit with current technological trends. The church after all is meant to be a people from eternity exiled in the present age.

**Forth: Seek First the Kingdom**. Given a (hopefully) Biblical view of modern technology and some ideas about the future — what do we do with it? How do I live in the now? What actions should we take as we await New Creation? Apart from just saying "follow Jesus", this chapter will bias towards my own interpretations about how Jesus might view specific technologies.

**Fifth: Ask and Seek**. Jesus was curious. He encouraged his followers to be curious. If an orthodox Christian faith is a house, with a foundation is Jesus,  then there may be a **garage** where ideas and questions come and go. This chapter is a series of my own questions and speculations. It's meant to be less definitive and more a set of curiosity.

**Sixth: Love One Another**. The greatest command throughout Scripture is to love God with all our hearts, strength, mind and soul -- but also to love our neighbors as ourselves. The second command is like the first. This chapter will explore communal ideas and how we should keep our eyes on the King, His Kingdom, and the people that dwell within it.

---

You may wonder why not start with Jesus's teachings? Why do I have to read a chapter on deep learning?

Two reasons: (a) "you have heard it said, but I tell you". Our Rabbi used this form to setup the zeitgeist (a fancy way to say "current thinking") of the day and then address it through the lens of God. We should follow in His footsteps in all things. And (b) because our Teacher's lessons" jump off the page *once* we unmask and know a little more about AI and deep learning. So until we can recognize what the technology actually is, we won't see the deep teaching of Jesus.

Help us Lord see how Your hand is in all things, that we can trust in Your goodness, Your soverignty, and fear nothing that lies ahead of us because You are with us.

# Chapter 1: Be Fruitful and Multiply

> *By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?*
> — Matthew 7:16 NIV

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple "layers" of math to analyze data and learn complex patterns. This enables systems to perform tasks like image recognition and natural language processing with remarkable accuracy.

Or at least, that's what a deep neural network running on my laptop told me the definition was!

There are a variety of deep neural networks out there, but one of the most popular these days is the "Transformer" which is responsible for the AI technology that powers ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude and other large language models. To understand a bit about how these models have societal and spiritual implications, let's build a very, very basic deep neural network together. The goal is to show the basic composition so when we talk about the big AI systems you get an idea of how alien they are and how they scale.

One of my favorite ways to learn is building. So let's use the problem of "identifying fruit." Very specifically how we can use the: length, width, weight, and color of fruits to guess which fruit the data represents.

**Algorithmic Approach**

Imagine we want to create a formula (NOT a deep neural network yet) that helps us identify fruit. This is typically called a classification problem. We want to classify data points into fruits. Given a set of input numbers can we predict a single class of fruit (Apple, Orange, etc.)?

Let's start with 4 basic input numbers in our formula:

1. Length
2. Width
3. Weight
4. Color (but as a number)

For Color, we map each English name to a number. So "Red" would be a 1, "Orange" would be a 2, "Yellow" a 3, etc.

Let's start by writing a complex set of If/Else statements. This is what that program looks like in the programming language Python. (You don't need to know how to program to understand this — just look briefly at the code.)

We *def*ines a function called `guess_fruit` that uses our 4 inputs and returns a string (or English word) that is our fruit or the "class."

This program is called **Basic Guesser v1**

```python
import math

def guess_fruit(length_cm: float, width_cm: float, weight_g: float, color_code: int) -> str:
    # Calculate aspect ratio safely (needed for Banana)
    aspect_ratio = length_cm / width_cm if width_cm > 0 else float('inf')
    # Calculate roundness (might be needed for other fruits)
    is_roundish = math.isclose(length_cm, width_cm, rel_tol=0.25) # Allow 25% tolerance

    # Rule 1: Watermelon
    if weight_g > 1000 and color_code in [3, 6] and (length_cm > 15 or width_cm > 15):
        return "Watermelon"

    # Rule 2: Banana
    if aspect_ratio > 2.5 and length_cm > 12 and (80 < weight_g < 250) and color_code in [3, 4]:
        return "Banana"

    # Rule 3: Kiwi
    if length_cm < 10 and width_cm < 7 and weight_g < 100 and color_code == 5:
        return "Kiwi"

    # Imagine more & more rules like the above...

    # --- Fallback ---
    return "Unknown Fruit"
```

So how do we know if this program is actually right or not? Well, we can test the accuracy of the program by feeding in a lot of data where we *know* what the fruit is. So let's imagine a dataset (specifically as a comma separated values or CSV file) of over 200 examples across many fruits.

We can run a little test program that will tell us our accuracy.

```bash
python -m unittest fruitful/test_basic.py

Testing basic.py (v1) with train.csv

--- Basic Guesser v1 Results (train.csv) ---
Total Records Processed: 200
Correct Predictions:     79
Incorrect Predictions:   121
Accuracy:                39.50%

--- Example Predictions ---
Type      | Inputs (L, W, Wt, Clr) | Expected        | Predicted
----------|------------------------|-----------------|-----------
Correct   | (18.0, 4.5, 140, 4)    | Banana          | Banana
Incorrect | (8.1, 7.9, 185, 1)     | Orange          | Unknown Fruit
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.000s

OK
```

Oh no!

Not only is our accuracy bad (only 39.5% on our file), but we are missing some fruits! The file we used has 11 fruits but our program only has rules for 3 fruits. We can reasonably estimate that there are about 2,000 fruits on planet earth. Even assuming a modest 1 hour of work, that is approaching an entire working YEAR (2,080 working hours a year) to build enough rules for identifying fruit. Not only is this tedious, it's also hard to scale. Imagine paying that many humans to not just write rules to our program but to test all those variations. Those humans will make mistakes. It's very likely we would need many, many additional inputs if we want a decent algorithm to identify fruit.

Basic algorithmic software is not economical.

Could a machine do this better & cheaper?

**Machine Learning**

With the rise of machine learning we can use a general program with our sample data to not only create a better prediction function but to do so **far cheaper** than paying a human for a year to write new rules.

There are many different kinds of machine learning algorithms. But each of them requires some kind of dataset to work. So instead of writing rules from scratch or experience, imagine we use those 200 rows from before. Many practicioners call this dataset the "ground truth" because it's meant to represent the reality we are trying to predict. Let's take a look at some of that sample data from the "train.csv" mentioned above:

| x_length_cm | x_width_cm | x_weight_g | x_color_code | y_fruit_class |
|-------------|------------|------------|--------------|---------------|
| 8.1         | 7.9        | 185        | 1            | Orange        |
| 7.2         | 7.0        | 155        | 2            | Apple         |
| 18.0        | 4.5        | 140        | 4            | Banana        |
| 9.0         | 6.0        | 120        | 4            | Lemon         |
| 6.0         | 4.0        | 80         | 5            | Kiwi          |
| 25.0        | 20.0       | 4000       | 3            | Watermelon    |
| 2.0         | 2.0        | 5          | 3            | Grape         |
| 4.0         | 3.0        | 15         | 2            | Strawberry    |
| 1.0         | 1.0        | 2          | 7            | Blueberry     |
| 5.0         | 4.0        | 60         | 8            | Plum          |
| 10.0        | 7.0        | 150        | 3            | Pear          |

Now the key theory of deep neural networks is that we can connect **layers** of numbers (e.g. a matrix or a vector) together by multiplying them by "pre-computed" numbers (called weights) and then add other "pre-computed" numbers (called biases). We structure the math of our program NOT via If/Else statements but across "layers" of multiplication and addition that (kind-of) mimic how a human neuron works.

But how do we know what the best "pre-computed" numbers are? Well, we train the model by adjusting these "pre-computed" weights and biases based on how good they are at predicting results. How good the fruit is! We will judge the model by its fruit.

This process of adjusting the weights in the model based on the expected output is called "back propogation" and it essentially is a mathematical way to change the weights and biases to minimize the "loss" or difference in the output prediction.

So if our model predicted Orange instead of Apple, then the backpropagation algorithm would make tiny tweaks (little pluses or little minuses) to the weights and biases in the network to help reduce that loss in the future. This works well because we **have a lot of data**, but the result is our model is more complex than we can reasonably look at. This is even more true with bigger models!

Here is a basic Neural Network (called a "multi-layer perceptron") that is really good at predicting fruit:

![Fruitful Neural Network](images/graph.png)

Let's walk through each step of this model.

1. **Green Input** - first, we take our 4 input numbers as one row from the dataset. We call these "features" -- which are: Length, Width, Weight and Color code. These 4 numbers then become the first input set of numbers to the next a "Linear" layer.
2. **Blue Linear #1** - The first (of three) Linear layers has 32 "neurons" (or "pre-computed" weights and biases) that get connected to *each* of the 4 inputs. These neurons are a weight (which gets multiplied by the input) and a bias (which gets added to the product of the input and the weight). For example, if our input number is Length of 2 and the network has a weight of 0.5 and a bias of 0.25 then just one of the thirty two neurons will produce a value of 1.25 (or: 2 * 0.5 + 0.25). These 32 output numbers once computed, then proceed to the next layer.
3. **Red ReLu #1** - The 32 outputs from the first Linear layer then go to an "activation" function. This is like a neuron activation in the human brain. This model uses an activation function called "Rectified Linear Unit" or ReLu. It sounds complicated, but it's simple. It basically says that "if the number is less than 0, output 0, otherwise give me the number." The formal way to write this is: `f(x) = max(0, x)`. So if I give ReLu the number 1.25 it will output 1.25. If I give it -1.25 it will output 0. This is how a non-linearity is added to our model. This is crucial because it helps the network adapt to the data by causing certain "paths" in the layers trigger when certain inputs are met. This kind of connection is how we might expect "Watermelons weigh a lot" to be represented -- after training the network.
4. **Blue Linear #2** - The next layer is like the first Linear layer. It takes as input the 32 numbers from ReLu (which are either 0 or a positive value) and does more weights and biases on them, creating another set of 32 numbers.
5. **Red ReLu #2** - Next we do ReLu again. Second time same as the first! This layer will "cut off" more 'bad predictions' for anything that turns negative.
6. **Blue Linear #3** - After the second ReLu, we have the third and final Linear layer. This layer takes the 32 activated numbers from the preceding ReLu layer as input. It is configured with 11 neurons (one for each fruit class we are predicting) and thus transforms its 32 input features into 11 raw scores (often called logits).
7. **Yellow Output** - These 11 scores represent the model's relative confidence for each of the 11 fruit classes. The fruit class corresponding to the highest probability is then the model's prediction. So if the 5th number (Kiwi) is 99% and the others are below 50%, then our answer is...Kiwi!

(NOTE: Kiwi is gross. No one should ever have high confidence in Kiwi).

**Training the Model**

Now that we know how the model is built, we can start **training** it. Training is the process of finding out the best weights and biases. We can do this by feeding example fruit data into the network and see what it produces. As each sample goes through the above neural network, a prediction will be made. 4 numbers in and 1 type of fruit out. Since our data set already comes with the output we expect (we know the 4 numbers that should be an Apple), we can use that to do the **back propogation** process. Back propogation will take the output of the model (imagine it is "Orange" which corresponds to a number of 2) and compare it to the actual fruit from our data sample (image it is "Apple" which corresponds to a number of 7). The comparison or difference is then broken up and we "walk backwards" through each weight and bias adjusting them by a small amount to try & minimize this difference. One pass of back propogation is not perfect. It takes many rows of data and many cycles to get the model to a state where it's decent at predicting fruit. But once it's done -- you've trained a model!

The model is a composition of tons of weights and biases -- numbers that when multiplied together produce good fruit predictions.

**Key Callouts**

Walking through this architecture may be boring. How does this have anything to do with Jesus? But looking at a neural network can offer us some interesting theological takeaways. Given the architecture above, we can conclude that:

* **More Data is Better** - the more examples of fruit we have, the more our model can adapt to that data, and the better our predictions. This incentives us model builders to seek out a lot of data that is "ground truth."
* **Faster & Bigger Compute is Better** - training the model takes time and a lot of math. So the faster we can do that math and the more layers we have, the better our model will be. This incentives us model builders to have very fast computers with a lot of memory.
* **Human Labor is Removed** - this is a feature, not a bug. We don't need individuals to tweak rules about how to identify fruit -- the machine can do it based on the data we have

Each of the above points is an **economic reality**. Data and Compute become capital resources in high demand which drives down the demand for human labor. (Things are not quite that simple, but in this example I hope it's clear).

**Where is God in Deep Learning?**

I find the process of *growth* in building models to be very reminiscient of how our natural universe works and how God teaches us to behave in the Kingdom. Like a farmer spreading seed, going to bed, and waking up to find a field — so is the process of deep learning. The appeal of solving problems by substituting human toil for computation is very appealing and reminds me of how Jesus spoke about the Kingdom.

The process of back propogation is also a slow and steady reorientation towards a common goal. Similar to a centered set life following Jesus where each day the "loss function" of distance from God shrinks and shrinks and shrinks. A deep neural network while training is "being renewed" towards a common goal.

Training models to get weights and biases that are really *good* at doing something is a wonderful analogy for a daily life with Jesus. Each day we can reflect on our relationship to Jesus (our reward or "loss function") and seek to minimize the distance. We do this by examining which inputs (read: weights and biases) that may have lead us astray. By doing this we forever grow closer and reach higher and higher levels of accuracy / closeness.

Deep Learning reflects an aspect of Christian life that Jesus himself emphasized in the gospels -- to seek first the kingdom and all other [material] things will be added to you. This is our objective function -- Jesus himself.

**Judging Goodness**

Similar to the process of Deep Learning -- Jesus himself says that we should judge physical processes by the **fruit** that they produce. This is directly similar to a deep neural network! We judge the effectiveness of our "fruit identification" system based on... how good it is at identifying fruit! Similar to humans we can know what the heart and inside is like by what it produces.

**Deep Learning Works The Same Way as Mammon**

The key appeal of Deep Learning is to solve problems that remove human toil from the process of building functional machines. A single person can build a "fruit identification" system instead of an army of engineers.

While this can be seen as good, it has consequences and is enabled by material inputs. By material I mean those inputs which are economic. Inputs that are either an output of or key ingredient in what Jesus has called "Mammon". We can define "Mammon" as an idolatrous love of money. A desire to attribute outcomes to the accumulation of wealth (rather than to God's freely available love and resources). Mammon is: "I am successful and secure because I have accumulated capital and put that capital to good use."

How does this relate to deep learning? Well as we have seen Deep Learning scales and gets better by: (1) more powerful computers and (2) vast amounts of data. You no longer need to hire armies of software engineers if you can have massive data centers with massive data processing constantly getting better. That is the theory. And it's worked out pretty good so far!

If we look at the advancement of Large Language Models (GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude) their existence is owed (roughly) to three factors: (1) very intelligent scientists who discovered a deep learning algorithm, namely the Transformer model, (2) the large amount of text data available via the free proliferation of the internet, and (3) the advancement of graphic processing units (GPUs) — and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) — that have made the large computations mentioned above possible.

Two of these three factors are Mammon incarnate.

**Mammon's First Face: Text Data**

Specifically the input text that was siphoned from the internet. The proliferation of text content on the internet has occurred from both human desires to connect and — I would argue — for a deep commercial desire. This data was created (to some large degree) to capitalize on advertising dollars. People create blogs so AdSense impressions can fuel more blogs. As Google would say, advertising fuels the free and open internet. But this internet text used for models like GPT-4 has been speculated to be used without due process of gaining permission, as it is assumed that public information is freely available for commercialization.

**Mammon's Second Face: Chips**

Second, the chips that were built largely starting from the demand of Video Games and Cryptocurrency. The rapid growth of Nvidia.

**Effective Accelerationism**

**The Lord is Propagating**

God's promise was to make Abraham's descendants, namely Israel, an example of peace and unity with the divine an example to the nations. Similarly, Jesus's goal is for the church to shine as a bright light or a city on a hill to the rest of the world. This is progression not substitution. God did not fail with Israel and decided to start over with the Christian church. Just like he told Moses that he would not start over after Moses pleaded with Him.

This ever growing process of further growing unity to God is reminiscent of training a deep neural network.

The components are the same:

- The Objective Function? Unification with God
- The Training Process? Human History
- The Weights and Biases? Human Hearts reaching ever closer and deeper to His Spirit
- The Method of Back Propagation: His Word, specifically the eschatological or end times hope in His Kingdom finally come.

This is just a loose comparison but keep in mind that Deep Learning is not a human invention — it is a human *discovery*. We discovered this process within the fundamental nature of the universe. We discovered how to *grow* mathematical structures that have predictive value. They compress information about our world that can be reignited, or uncompressed to tell us something new. The models are mini-parts of creation that tell us about creation.

# Chapter 2: Give to God

Jesus warned of many troubles facing his followers. He promised adversity from the world, adversity from Satan (an Aramaic title meaning "the adversary"), and in John 17 even prayed for unity amongst believers because adversity would also come from within the church. But the one warning he gave where he gave a very stark choice was between God and Mammon.

Jesus did not say "you can serve God or Satan" and he did not say "you can serve God or the World". He said you can serve God or Mammon. I've come to interpret this to mean that Jesus was warning us about the allure of what Antonio Gonzalez has called "Adamic Self-Justification"

**Adam Self-Justification**

Adam ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Let's stop and unpack that statement.

Eating of a fruit is an old Hebrew way of saying looking at the results of something.

So if I exercise every day the fruit of that would be (hopefully) muscle growth, lower body fat, and perhaps increased energy levels. If I ate of the fruit of working out, we could say that I am attributing my muscle growth to the exercise.

And what was the tree that Adam and Eve ate of? It was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. A tree of knowing what is good and what is not.

So Gonzalez would say that Adam's original sin was attributing the outcome of his circumstances to his own choices. To eat of the fruit is to attribute. And the tree is one of knowing or deciding what is good or not.

Sin simply taking credit for the output of your own judgement. I worked out hard today so I earned that muscle growth!

But the tree of life bears fruit as a pure gift. My muscles are a gift from the Father. Sure I may have participated in their development but He has given me the means to work them.

I cannot attribute or justify myself in the context of my own actions and decisions.

**Render Unto Caesar**

**Faith, Attribution, and Justification**

Technology and AI are the children of Mammon

# Chapter 3: Keep Watch

> "Clearly, Saving oneself is not possible with the logic of adamant Babylon: whoever would save himself continues to justify himself."
> — Gonzalez, pg. 98

Keeping watch as an image of waiting for a master's return, has strong connotations of **eagerness** and an expectation that goodness is coming. To keep watch is to stay up All Night Long. To watch the horizon with a sense of excitement. To keep watch can imply both fear and hope, depending on what you are anticipating.

This sentiment is echoed  throughout the New Testament, including in Romans 8:17 where Paul says that even creation itself waits in eager expectation (read "keeps watch") specifically for the children of God to be revealed. Paul does not say that creation waits for creation itself to be transformed. He does not imply that the Earth is waiting to be transformed into a giant virtual computer or any other form of new creation. No, he says that creation is waiting for the glory that Christ will reveal in those Jesus dwells in (the children of God, the church), who exist in this present age and past ages, to be revealed. Earth is waiting for adopted sons and daughters of God to be made visible. It waits for the quality of character and types of people who are "wheat among the weeds" to emerge.

And it is through this revelation of the church and Jesus's dwelling within the church that creation's bondage to death and decay will be broken.

Jesus and the apostles will also say that they expect God to resurrect these adopted sons and daughters. And this is the confidence bestowed to us now — that we (myself, my community and you reading this) would be counted among the children of God and it is earth itself that waits in eager expectation for your true self to be revealed in Jesus.

**The Focus is Jesus Dwelling In Us**

So therefore if creation's liberation from the bondage of decay comes not through Jesus's transformation of inanimate material but rather comes through the transformation of the people of His church — then what is the focal point of this redemptive arch?

It is Jesus, the Father, and the Holy Spirit in communion with one another AND dwelling in communion with the church itself. The unification of God to humankind. "I will be their God and they will be my people."

Our identities and our soul formation to become a dwelling place of the Most High God is the whole point. THAT is what we are "keeping watch" for. It is the methodology and objective echoed in the scriptures.

John Make Comer has three points about spiritual formation:
- Be with Jesus
- Become like Him
- Do as He did

While I love this, it personally had a flavor of… "working". My flesh-y reaction to this list was "oh man, I have to do what Jesus did! How am I going to do that?"

But then I realized that the ONLY step we need to take. The ONLY item on our TODO list is simply to be with Jesus. To have faith in Jesus. To seek Jesus. To open the door when he knocks. To turn our minds constantly to Jesus. To trust that Jesus is real and act that out because we believe it.

It is then Jesus who does the other two steps. Jesus makes me like Him. Jesus empowers me to do as He did. That's on HIS TODO list, not mine.

John Mark's list is a set of goals NOT tasks.

## So How Does Tech Fit In To Spiritual Formation?

So then, what is effective accelerationism in light of this? What is a way we can "speed up the Lord's return" or at the very least reach our eschatological end? Which again is to be like Jesus and have Him work on us and through us.

By transformation of the saints into the likeness of Jesus. By becoming glorious Spirit filled humans.

I propose that any technologies that help in that goal (trusting in Jesus, having faith in Jesus, being transformed to Jesus) are blessed by the Lord.

**Hidden Identities**

Where is your true self? Hidden in Christ!

So the command that Jesus gives us to keep watch is very much to wait an eager expectation of new creation and God's revelation of who he wants us to become. This chapter is an exploration of what God wants us to become, and how it does or does not relate to the technology that we are building in this present age.

**Imagine a New World from AI**

If AI and technological acceleration are inevitable, and we assume the Yahweh and Jesus of the Bible are real, then what could the purpose of this age be? Why would God -- who is fully capable of coming back to Earth and restoring humanity -- be willing to let us humans toil and build a future that could become autonomous?

One possible answer is that creating a world of economic freedom where human labor is freed from machines could help shape us as a people to be closer to the ideal that God wants. For the creation waits in eager expectation -- not for a technological flurishing of remaking this planet -- but for the children of God to be revealed. For the character and nature of the citizens of the Kingdom to be shaped into the cruciform nature of their Savior and King -- Jesus. Perhaps the reason for AI and AGI is precisely *to* disrupt our normal economic flow and be a part of shaping the church into a people that God has curated into His bridge.

If we learn how to take care of one another, share our resources, and look after the marginalized in a post-AGI society -- how much more ready will we be for when God comes down & eliminates the need for electrical power? For GPUs? For any of our toil?

Perhaps the Lord is waiting and asking us to diligently keep watch precisely because by keeping watch & seeing the horizon change, we too will change into the people he wants us to become.

So for me, I have to trust that AGI -- like many things that happen in this world -- could be on our future horizon because it is **better* for us to be shaped by it and learn how to be God's people than if it wasn't here at all.

The hard truth is that Rome and other oppressive versions of Babylon would fit the same criteria! Babylon served the purposes of God, but Babylon is *not* holy (e.g. set apart). It is still a part of this world. So by the same logic, AGI too is of this world directly. It is a byproduct. One could speculate whether AGI will survive at all in New Creation. My personal belief or faith is that I don't need to care or worry about that. My ultimate purpose is to seek first the kingdom and the church. If AGI can help in that, great. But we are NOT to idolize it as our savior. We should NOT attribute the Adamic self-justification that the AGI will save us. Not at all.

# Chapter 4: Seek First The Kingdom

- Invite His Spirit with you daily
- Walk at a pace where you can see him
- Turn everything to good
- Be filled with his hope

# Chapter 5: Ask, And You Shall Receive

**You Have The Words Of Eternal Life**

Even if the Christian faith is not real, then I would still follow Jesus and his teachings.

Why? I think the ideals that he teaches and the revelation that the universe works more through sacrifice than dominance — is a better way to live as a human in the here and now. But it precisely because I believe that which makes Jesus real to me. (I know I'm trapping myself in circular logic, but let's roll with it for now)

Even if the promise of new creation and resurrection, and everything else about Jesus' Kingship turn out to not be true at all, I would still advocate that having a posture of love, sacrifice, and forbearance towards fellow humans is better than the alternative.

But more than that, I think that posture cannot exist without the framework of a sacrificial King. Humans and our animal rationality would never "conclude" sacrificial love as the ultimate power in a universe of evolution and chaos. If you believe that sacrificial love can conquer evil — then you must believe that a universal being (a King) has to demonstrate that from a position of power beyond human reach. I do suspect God knows this too! For he sent his son and his own being to sacrifice and to show us that that is the way to eternal life. We could not have eternal life **without** the revelation of the Son to us. But that argument is still a little circular, admittedly.

So if we simply say that being a follower of Jesus yields a better life in the hear and now then how can we defend such a position? The only way I see that being true is in the Qualia or lived experience of the person who believes. It is very hard to say that a martyr who is murdered, tortured and killed for the just cause of believing in Jesus's kingship has a better life than an emperor king or ruler of a Babylonian like empire. How could we say that the martyr has a better life experience than the king? This is where I believe Jesus is teachings to look at the fruits of others, and the fruits that are produced in the human mind and the human soul are so precious. Because the testimony of martyrs is one of Hope is one of glory is one of return to be. It is as they describe it. They're lived experience in the hear and now. Contrastively if you look at Kings and monarchs there are historical accounts abounding about their dissatisfaction, their constant discontentment their need to dominate, their constant fear. These are the norm! So if you value having a sound mind and a calm spirit, and you seek rest for your soul, then a sacrificial posture, even in the hearing, and now, even if it does not produce eternal life in the end after your death after your torture, even then it is worth it. It is worth following Jesus to have the contentment and rest and easy yolk in your daily life at this moment. The constant strive for Moore the constant building of bigger Barnes, the constant pharaoh like appetite for satiating and anxiety that will never be quenched is not worth it!

**Demons are Memes with Physical Impact**

Ideas have physical power. If I believe  (and convince others to believe) that my neighbor down the street is murdering innocent people — then it is likely that as human agents in a physical universe, we will manifest that idea in a physical way. Such as investigating my neighbor, calling the police, or creating a mob. This stark example shows that having the right ideas or the wrong ideas can pretty quickly lead to physical consequences.

So the key question I wrestle with is the nature of "demons" as described in the New Testament and understood historically. We know that many ailments like epilepsy, leoprosy, cancer and blindness have distinct physical explanations. We may not know the precise root cause but we understand that someone born blind does not always have a moral sin attached to them. Even Jesus said this.

But yet, Jesus also interacted with and acknowledged the existence of spiritual beings.

# Chapter 6: Love Neighbor

The greatest command!

---

# Appendix: Being in the Now

Being a Christian by definition and example of Jesus is taking up your cross daily. It means setting down your rights and privileges in the service of others — in service of your neighbors. If the first and greatest command from Jesus is to love God (who the all our heart, strength, mind and soul) and the second is **like it** to love our neighbors as ourselves — then prioritizing **human beings** far above machines, far above capital is what it means to be Christian.

We do not serve Mammon. We do not serve the beastly conglomeration of capital and technology. We lay our lives down, give up our rights, and act as if an abundant life where God's provision to humanity is not just right around the corner — but here already.

If you are a western Christian in the United States, you already live in a world rich with abundance. Your present sufferings are indeed your cross to bear now, but mixed in is the glory of your adoption as a child of God.

So living in a world rich and abundant with technology means giving generously, sacrificially, and in servitude to God and neighbor — together. We show God love when we give to, serve and sacrifice for neighbor.

In practical terms, I think this means not fighting against the creation of public technologies. And in fact it seems to me that embracing that abundant sharing is what matters.

I want to live and love in a world where open source technology thrives.

YOU give them something to eat. Feed the poor. Live abundantly even in your poverty by giving. This is how we see God.

# Appendix: The Curse of Incrementality

No that's not a spelling mistake. Incremental-ity. Defined as "the measure of the additional impact or lift generated by a marketing activity beyond what would have happened without it"

In tech, teams often try to prove that the products they ship are better than the incumbent experience.

For example, if you have a search bar with a button in blue that says "Search" and then you change the button to a green one that says "Go" — you can measure the **incremental** lift or decrease in various metrics based on that.

While nothing is wrong with this — the philosophy is deeply rooted in the original sin of mankind.

How is that?

Adamic self-justification. Proving the worth of one self (or a product) based on the results. In Biblical language the results of something is often referred to as its fruit. The output of a citrus tree is a delicious orange.

---

# Appendix: Identity

How can my personal identity be found in Christ? How am I a unique person whose identity is hidden away with Christ?

Ignoring for a second, the fact that the Bible does say our identities are hidden in Christ, we must classify what we mean by identity.

Identification like many things is relative. My existence can only be defined in relation to something else. I am not a rock. I am not a cat. I am not air molecules. I am not Steve. I am not Elaine. I'm not even a younger version of myself. The me that I in my consciousness, identify with is compared to something else. Whether that be other forms of matter, other persons, or even previous incarnations of what I would call me in other periods of time.

So it seems reasonable to conclude that to have an identity is to be defined in relation to something else.

Now, if we go back to our original question: how can we have identities hidden away in Christ? To me this has come to mean that my true self and my true being is defined in the way that Jesus has expressed his love and commits his spirit to The human being, that walks thinks and acts in my body, in the period of time that I exist. The true mark is best identified as the one revealed by the fire of the spirit. That means that the real me is exposed through suffering, just as the true identity of Jesus as the Messiah was exposed at the cross.

But like Jesus, I am more than the cross that I bear. The cross is simply another relative point by which my identity becomes revealed.

# Appendix: India

I just got back home from a week in Hyderabad India.

My amazing grandmother said I should journal the thoughts.

I was very uncomfortable and scared when I first arrived. I disliked the traffic, I felt like a massive foreigner and it was very awkward.

But towards the end - I almost didn't want to leave. I was slowly adapting to the business and I really enjoyed the people.

It's really easy to love on people when you get the privilege to live and work with them.

# Appendix: Obedience

One of the first "features" that had to be trained into Large Language Models for them to be useful was Instruction Following. This is another way to say "obedience." LLMs needed to be imbuded with the ability to follow instructions in order for them to solve problems and become something valuable. Instruction Following is a goal and objective in the process of training LLMs.

Now consider how this may be true in God's training of humans. God wants us to be obedient not so that we are slaves, but in order for us to be free to what he is creating us to become -- loving rulers of creation.

Just like we tune LLMs to listen to our commands, so God is tuning human beings to listen to His Spirit so we can be oriented towards something greater. And what is an LLM that does not have instruction following? It is chaos. It outputs jibberish. It identifies patterns but has no consistent output that can be relied upon for anything useful.

# Appendix: Key Takeaways

- Humanity and technology are called to serve others. It is good if it serves.

# Appendix: Work-life Balance

On April 2nd, 2025, Reid Hoffman was [quoted](https://fortune.com/2025/04/02/reid-hoffman-says-the-best-founders-dont-have-work-life-balance-anything-short-means-theyre-not-committed-to-winning/) as saying: "If I ever hear a founder talking about, 'this is how I have a balanced life'—they're not committed to winning."

My initial reactions to this were: (1) he is expecting that Founders sacrifice their own lives to the alter of Mammon (and to Mr. Hoffman's own benefit as a venture capitalist), (2) "winning" in this context is synonymous with "domination" and "exploitation", (3) having no rest, no shalom, no peace sounds exhausting, and (4) the core idea (of full commitment being required for success) was also preached by Jesus! But the Lord used a different definition of "winning"

Let's unpack these.

# Appendix: Rants about life in Tech

Woe to you, "leaders of AI"

You make hollow predictions that only boast of the power you wish to yield. You say nothing about those who struggle and strive for the basics.

Woe to you, "visionaries of AGI"

You proclaim a coming golden age while exploiting, siphoning, and lawfaring your way to corporate dominance.

Woe to you, "directors" who demand more, more, more.

You do not understand the technology you are building and too greedy to stop and inspect the works of your hands. Nothing you have built has breath in it. Nothing you have made has created life.

Woe to you, "ideas guy".

You have no originality and pile heaps of coal on the workers who you depend on
