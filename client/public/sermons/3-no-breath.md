# No Breath In It: AI, Idolatry, and the Children of Mammon

**Core Scripture:** Habakkuk 2:18-19

## Key Point 1: There Is No Breath In It

Habakkuk's taunt against idols seems outdated—our modern AI *can* speak, *can* give guidance, *can* teach. But the prophet's deeper insight remains: "there is no breath in it." Breathing is communion with environment, connection to place, the reception of life from outside oneself. Our creations lack this. They have no ruach, no pneuma, no Spirit. They can be moved from place to place with no consequence. They are powerful tools, but they are not alive.

| Habakkuk 2:18-19 | "Of what value is an idol carved by a craftsman? Or an image that teaches lies? For the one who makes it trusts in his own creation; he makes idols that cannot speak. Woe to him who says to wood, 'Come to life!' Or to lifeless stone, 'Wake up!' Can it give guidance? It is covered with gold and silver; there is no breath in it." |
| Psalm 150:6 | "Let everything that has breath praise the LORD. Praise the LORD." |

## Key Point 2: AI as Evolution of Mammon and the Powers

Deep learning is driven by economic reality: data and compute as capital resources. The advancement of LLMs is owed to (1) intelligent scientists, (2) massive text data siphoned from the internet (advertising-driven), and (3) GPUs/TPUs (built for games and crypto). Two of three factors are Mammon incarnate. AI is not neutral—it is an evolution of Mammon, a new expression of the powers and principalities. Capital is its own intelligence, accelerating toward... what?

| Colossians 2:8 | "See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces of this world rather than on Christ." |
| Ephesians 6:12 | "For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms." |
| 2 Corinthians 10:4-5 | "The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God..." |

## Key Point 3: Judge the Fruit: Isolation vs. Flourishing

Jesus tells us to judge by fruit. What fruit has our technological acceleration produced? Men with 6+ close friends dropped from 55% (1990) to 27% (2021). Adults with no partner rose from 29% to 38%. Startup culture worships sacrifice to the altar of building—Reid Hoffman's pronouncement that balanced founders aren't "committed to winning." But winning *what*? The Kingdom response is open-source abundance, technological charity, sharing freely what we've been given.

### Scripture

| Scripture | Text |
|-----------|------|
| Matthew 7:16-20 | "By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit... Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them." |
| Deuteronomy 32:16-17 | "They made him jealous with their foreign gods and angered him with their detestable idols. They sacrificed to false gods, which are not God—gods they had not known, gods that recently appeared, gods your ancestors did not fear." |

*Am I creating an idol? Am I worshipping false gods? Technology as Mammon's child—neither worshipped nor rejected, but discerned by its fruit.*
